# Welcome to Jijun Chen's GitHub!

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Physics working with Prof. David Koltick @ Purdue University (2018.08~2023.12). My research focuses on data analysis and simulation of high-energy particles. I use data analysis and numerical simulation, and image processing to understand the physics phenomenon. I have applied Machine learning to solve challenging problems.



Starting from 2019-03, I am working as 
Built pipelines to automate meta data extraction from images/videos with Apache Airflow, Kubernetes, MinIO, Docker.
Extracted metadata from images/videos with fine-tuned optical character recognition (OCR) models.
